 * <p>
 * Component that listens to changes in the graph managed by Hawk. These changes
 * are TX_MODE: listeners should only react to changes after the
 * transaction has been confirmed, or be prepared to roll back if the
 * transaction is not successful.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Event sequences are usually one of two types:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>synchroniseStart - (changeStart - rest of events -
 * changeSuccess/changeFailure)* - synchroniseEnd, for synchronisations between
 * Hawk and its monitored VCS repositories.</li>
 * <li>changeStart - rest of events - changeSuccess/changeFailure, for other
 * changes (such as registering a metamodel).</li>
